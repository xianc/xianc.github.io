			<h1>The Design Process</h1>
			<p>
				I wanted to break free from the traditional one page bootstrap style layouts that many sites are fashioning these days. I wanted to create a site whoes navigation is not a dropdown menu nor a horizontal bar. So I went to photoshop and made a very basic image of how wide I want the navigation to be compared to the content body.<br/>

				I chosed the colors out of whim. I went with a very dark grey and a very light grey instead of black and white. Its a habit that I developed after doing years of traditional art. 
			</p>

				The very next step, and the most important step for me, is to choose a colour theme. This is the most important step, because colour inspires me. If I don't select a good colour combination, the layout design ends up falling flat. I just need to find one colour that inspires me, and I can work from there.
				<br/>
				I decided that I want a vibrant colour and went on the internet and search for "flat colors" for inspiration. One of the first search results I got was <a href="http://www.flatdesigncolors.com/assets/colors.png">this</a>. And I was immediately drawn to the Persian Green.

				<br/>
				From there, I started building on my wireframe. It turns out, I really like the original background colours against the persian green, so I kept it and just worked with some composition and styling for the links.

				At this point, I just need to add some small finishing touches before jumping into the code. I found some nice flat icons created by <a href="http://www.webappers.com/2013/07/18/free-minimalist-flat-design-social-media-icons/">Jorge Calvo</a> on Google and added to the bottom of the navigation menu. I noticed that the content column is lacking some green, so I layered a persian green dotted background over the light grey.
